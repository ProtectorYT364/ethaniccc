**__So apparently this is possible__**

I am `ethaniccc`, (pronounced e - than - ick) an **`idot`** 14 year old who is just doing things for fun - mainly Pocketmine plugin development.

### Favorite Projects
* **__Mockingbird__** - An anti-cheat made for Pocketmine servers. You can click [here](https://www.github.com/ethaniccc/Mockingbird) to check it out.

* **__IdotBook / IdotHub__** - A website with a registration, login, and posting system made for fun in my free time. The website is no longer kept up 24/7.
You can click [here](https://www.github.com/ethaniccc/IdotHub) to check out the websites source code. The websites database information has been hacked by
@mmm545 once but from then I used encryption and he can no longer SQLMap my website :D

* **__IdotBot__** - My seonnd project in Javascript. This was a discord bot made to replicate my friends Discord bot "Pepperoni" that is written in script. This project
is very messy and I doubt I'm going to go back to continue it lol. If I ever do continue IdotBot, I would start it from scratch. You can click [here](https://github.com/ethaniccc/IdotBot) to check out the project.

* **__NoToSpanishClass__** - There are actually 2 versions of this, one in PHP and one in Javascript. The one in PHP was put up on a private website that was distributed to my friends
so we didn't have to go through the hassle of translating spanish stories our spanish teacher gave us online (the website prevented us from copy and pasting and would do somethibng weird if we tried to use Inspect).
You can click [here](https://github.com/ethaniccc/no-to-spanish-class) to check out the version in PHP, or you can click [here](https://github.com/ethaniccc/no-to-spanish-class-js) to check out the version in Javascript.
